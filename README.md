# customer-product-review-with-twilio-gemini

## Overview
I built a product review and rating App that allows product users to submit ratings along with descriptive feedback. The application analyzes the sentiment of the feedback and provides users with a personalized response based on their sentiment. The backend stores the ratings in a MySQL database and sends notifications using Twilio.

This app aims to help product owners gain valuable insights into customer satisfaction and areas for improvement.
